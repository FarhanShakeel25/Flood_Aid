# Flood Aid - User Guide

## Getting Started

Welcome to Flood Aid. This guide shows how to make donations, what to expect during payment, and how to get help if something goes wrong.

## Making a Cash Donation

1. Open the website and go to Donate.
2. Select "Cash" and enter your name, email, and amount in PKR.
3. Click "Proceed to payment".
4. You will be redirected to Stripe’s secure checkout.
5. Enter your card details and complete payment.
6. You’ll be redirected back to the Success page. Your actual paid amount is shown based on Stripe session details.

Notes:
- You can use Stripe test cards (e.g., 4242 4242 4242 4242) while testing.
- If the payment page takes a few seconds to appear, that’s normal on first load; subsequent loads are faster.

## Donating Supplies (In-Kind)

1. Select "Other Supplies".
2. Describe the items you want to donate.
3. Submit the form.
4. You’ll see a confirmation with a receipt ID.

## Confirmation Emails

- After cash or supplies donations, you’ll receive a confirmation email from Flood Aid.
- If you don’t receive it within a few minutes:
  - Check your spam folder.
  - Ensure the email address you entered is correct.
  - Try again later if email services are temporarily busy.

## Success and Cancel Pages

- Success page shows your donation details and receipt ID.
- Cancel page appears if you leave Stripe checkout without completing payment.

## Troubleshooting

- Payment didn’t load: Refresh the page and try again.
- Payment declined: Use a different card or contact your bank.
- Email not received: Check spam; verify your email address.
- Page not found: Use the home page link to navigate back.

## Privacy & Security

- Card details are processed by Stripe. Flood Aid never stores card numbers.
- Your email is used only to send donation confirmations.

## Contact

- For help, use the Contact page or reply to your confirmation email.
